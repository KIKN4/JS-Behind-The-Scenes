# JavaScript Behind the Scenes - Slidev Presentation

Welcome to the JavaScript Behind the Scenes presentation.

# About This Presentation

This presentation provides an in-depth look at JavaScript's inner workings, focusing on essential concepts like memory management, hoisting, dynamic and static memory, JS engine, execution context, the event loop, and asynchronous processing. This resource is perfect for developers who want to understand how JavaScript operates under the hood, from high-level overviews to detailed execution processes.

Key Topics Covered
High-Level Overview of JavaScript

Understanding JavaScript as a high-level, garbage-collected, and dynamically-typed language.
JavaScript Engine and Runtime

Insights into how the JavaScript engine compiles and executes code in a runtime environment.
Execution Context and Call Stack

Detailed explanation of the call stack and how functions and variables are managed during execution.
Scope and Scope Chain

Understanding variable scopes and how JavaScript resolves variables through the scope chain.
Variable Environment: Dynamic vs. Static Memory

Comparison between dynamic and static memory, with emphasis on JavaScript's dynamic memory allocation.
JavaScript's Non-Blocking Event Loop

Explanation of how JavaScript achieves asynchronous behavior with a single-threaded model using the event loop, microtask queue, and callback queue.
Slide Highlights
Each slide is designed to progressively build up understanding, using code snippets, diagrams, and visual explanations. Key visuals include:

Call Stack and Event Loop - An interactive visualization of the event loop, microtask queue, and callback queue to show JavaScript's asynchronous handling.
Execution Context in Detail - An overview of the global and local execution contexts and how JavaScript handles function calls, variable environments, and the this keyword.

Dynamic vs. Static Memory - A comparison to explain JavaScript's memory management and garbage collection.
